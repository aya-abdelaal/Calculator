# Kotlin Calculator App
My first Kotlin app - a simple calculator.

 This project allowed me to experiment with different android concepts and pick up the Kotlin syntax.

**How it works :** The engine utilizes stacks to convert the inputted expression into a postfix expression and then evaluating it.

### Concepts : 
While building the app, I got to understand different android concepts such as

 - view binding
 - changing styles and themes
 - extracting resources
 - logging and debugging
